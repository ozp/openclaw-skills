"""U2 inline-button RECEIVE half: decode a ``tt:`` tap and run the existing command.

The OpenClaw ``task-tracker-interactive`` plugin (``scripts/openclaw-plugins/``) shells
``callback_run.sh`` -> this module with a SINGLE argv element: a JSON object
``{"callback_data": "<action>:<task_id>[:<arg>]", "sender_id": "<id>", "topic_id": "<id>"}``.
``callback_data`` is the payload AFTER the ``tt`` namespace (the gateway split it off the
first ``:``), so we re-prepend ``tt:`` and decode it with the SAME U1 codec
(``telegram_buttons.decode``) -- one source of truth for the scheme on both sides.

What this module IS: a thin transport that turns a decoded tap into ONE invocation of an
EXISTING command (``done`` / ``snooze`` / ``reschedule`` / ``carry`` / ``drop`` / ``approve`` /
``set-top`` / ``revert``) and prints ONE compact JSON result line. It adds no board semantics: every mutation
goes through the existing reversible, gated, receipted command path.

It invokes the underlying command MODULE directly (``nag_commands.py`` / ``harvest_ledger.py``)
rather than the ``telegram-commands.sh`` front-end. They are the SAME commands -- the shell is
just one front-end -- but the shell wrapper intentionally MASKS a non-``ok`` result behind a
friendly one-line notice (its job, for a human relay), which would discard the very structured
signal a tap needs: a STALE tap (``canonical-id-resolution-failed``) or a topic-guard rejection
(``wrong-topic``) must reach the plugin as data, not as a generic "unavailable". So the dispatcher
calls the module, which prints clean JSON on every path, and applies its own no-raw-error-leak
boundary via ``run_main``.

What this module is NOT: it is NOT an authorization point (KTD-4). ``sender_id`` is forwarded
but never trusted here; the downstream command + topic guard are the single authority (e.g.
``harvest_ledger.approve`` hard-rejects a tap whose ``topic_id`` != the Productivity Done topic).
The plugin added no bypass; this module adds none either.

NO RAW ERROR LEAK: the whole body runs inside ``error_envelope.run_main``, so a decode miss, a
bad args JSON, or a crashing command surfaces as ONE friendly line + exit 0 -- never a traceback
to Telegram. A STALE tap (the task is already done / no longer on the board / no open nag loop /
already harvested) is NOT an error: the downstream command reports it as a structured non-``ok``
result, which we pass through verbatim so the plugin can edit the message to a clean "already
actioned" -- the board was already in the desired state.

# structured JSON the shell would mask behind a friendly notice on a non-``ok`` result (stale /
# wrong-topic). ``snz``/``rsch`` map to the verbs ``snooze``/``reschedule`` so the result's
# ``action`` (``command_argv[0]``) matches the plugin's ackText keys.
#
# ``carry`` / ``drop`` are wired in U5 (their nag_commands verbs exist). ``top`` (set tomorrow's
# #1) is wired in U6: it maps to the ``set-top`` verb, which writes the tomorrow-pointer (no board
# mutation -- a STALE tap on an already-actioned task is refused as a structured non-ok result, not
