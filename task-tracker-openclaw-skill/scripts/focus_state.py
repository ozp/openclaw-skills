"""Sole reader/writer of ``focus-state.json`` (U3 Layer-1 state).

``focus-state.json`` records the morning Daily Top Priorities proposal and its
approval status. It is agent-runtime-owned state under
``cos_config.state_dir()`` (NOT Obsidian / not git-tracked).

Design rules honoured here:

* **Single writer.** Only this module writes ``focus-state.json``; every other
  unit reads it (U6 read-only). All writes go through ``utils._atomic_write``.
* **Stale-date is date-independent for the cap.** ``status_for_today()`` treats a
  state whose ``date != today`` as "not set" so Layer-1 priorities are
  re-proposed each morning. The Layer-2 capacity cap does NOT depend on this
  state at all (it governs total active load), so a skipped morning never
  silences the cap.
* **A corrupt state file never leaks and never silently erases.** A bad file is
  quarantined aside as ``.corrupt-<n>`` (forensics preserved) and treated as
  "no state", mirroring the autonomy_gate quarantine policy.
