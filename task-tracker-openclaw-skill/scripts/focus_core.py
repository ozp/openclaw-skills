"""Layer-2 capacity model: the active-inventory cap (Contract 6 / Decision #7).

The single home for "how loaded is the active board?" so the write-time gate in
``tasks.py``, the capacity display in ``standup.py``, and the morning proposal in
``defended_three.py`` all agree on one calculation. No unit re-derives the cap.

The model (two-layer; Layer 1 = daily priorities lives in ``defended_three.py``):

* Active set = ``task_records.active_records()`` -- every non-done, non-backlog,
  non-parking_lot task, INCLUDING ``section=None`` ("All Tasks") tasks. This is
  the single source of truth; ``focus-state.holding_tank`` members are a
  focus-state flag on active tasks, not a board section, so they are already
  counted here (they ARE active work, per the U3 mustFix).
* Estimate sum = ``sum(parse_duration(estimate::))`` over the active set, with
  unestimated tasks counted at ``UNESTIMATED_TASK_HOURS`` (default 2h) so a
  sparsely-estimated board is not silently under the ceiling.
* The cap is breached when EITHER the estimate-sum exceeds
  ``WEEKLY_CAPACITY_HOURS`` (default 25h) OR the active count exceeds
  ``ACTIVE_TASK_HARD_CAP`` (default 20). Breaching nudges a backlog move; it
  NEVER force-evicts existing tasks.
