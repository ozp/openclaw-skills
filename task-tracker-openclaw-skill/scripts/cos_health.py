"""H4 machine-visible health substrate: ``cos-health.json``.

Every ritual runs inside ``error_envelope`` which prints a friendly notice and
exits 0 (so the cron relay never sees a non-zero status). Good UX, but it means a
silently-broken cron looks healthy -- there is no machine-readable signal an
external watchdog can poll. This module is that signal: a small, flocked, atomic
map under ``cos_config.state_dir()`` recording, per ritual, when it last SUCCEEDED
and when it last FAILED (with the classified ``error_class``).

The file is a flat ``{ritual: {...}}`` dict. ``record_success`` / ``record_failure``
each run one read-modify-write under an exclusive sidecar flock -- the SAME idiom
``outbox._outbox_flock`` / ``nag_state`` use -- so a cron run and a reactive command
writing concurrently cannot lose each other's updates. ``_atomic_write`` (temp +
replace + fsync) keeps a torn write from corrupting the file mid-heartbeat.

Best-effort by contract: health recording is wired into the envelope's failure
path, so it must NEVER become a new failure source. ``read_health`` treats a
missing/corrupt file as ``{}`` and never raises; the recorders are wrapped
defensively at the call site (``error_envelope.run_main``). A success NEVER clobbers
a prior ``last_failure`` and a failure NEVER clobbers a prior ``last_success_ts`` --
the two facts coexist so a watchdog sees both "last good run" and "last bad run".

Timestamps are local-zone ISO via ``cos_config.local_now()`` (the same clock the
rituals/cron reason in), so a STALE-age comparison against ``local_now()`` in
``cos_manifest`` is apples-to-apples.
