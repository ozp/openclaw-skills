# captured stderr is written to the structured error log (NEVER echoed to
# stdout) and a friendly one-line notice is printed instead. The user/agent
# relay therefore never sees a Python traceback, exception class, or file path.

# (0 = ok, non-zero = failed) so a caller can branch on the status rather than
# scanning the rendered output for a glyph -- which is fragile because ⚠️ is not
# reserved for the envelope and can appear in normal task output.
