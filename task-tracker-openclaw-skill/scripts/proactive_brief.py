"""U6 proactive brief/debrief + focus-block cron entry point.

One module, four flows, ALL sharing one ironclad order (mustFix #5):

    resolve+PROVE delivery target FIRST  ->  do calendar/task work  ->  push to
    the PROVEN target only (gate<->message seam).

A push to an unprovable target is blocked before any freebusy or brief assembly
runs, and ``delivery_target_proof_failed`` is logged; nothing is sent.

Flows (selected by ``--mode``):

* ``brief``   -- daily morning context brief (idempotent via proactive-state).
* ``prebrief``-- ``*/5`` scan: for each upcoming event in the lead window, send a
  pre-brief ONCE (idempotent), and re-prompt any OPEN debrief loop (closes only
  on capture/skip, never by time).
* ``slip``    -- check active focus blocks; slide a slipped agent-owned block to
  the next free window via ``gog calendar update`` (NEVER delete+create).
* ``friday``  -- Friday next-week priority proposal to the weekly topic. It NEVER
  writes U3 ``focus-state.json`` -- it only proposes.

Brief CONTENT is built by small pure helpers (testable without a gateway); the
calendar I/O is the injectable ``calendar_blocks`` seam; the delivery proof is
``proactive_delivery``. NO-RAW-ERROR-LEAK: ``main`` wraps the whole run and prints
a safe envelope on any failure, exiting 0 so cron does not treat it as a failure.
