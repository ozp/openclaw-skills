"""U2 autonomy core: /undo + /audit over the Phase-0a act log.

Phase 0a (``autonomy_gate.py``) lands the gate, the act log, the delivery seam,
and the nag-state stub. U2 builds the *reactive surface* on top of it:

* ``list_acts(...)`` -- the read model behind ``/audit`` (recent acts, newest first).
* ``find_act_detail(...)`` -- the single-act detail behind ``/audit act_<id>``.
* ``undo_act(act_id)`` -- the reversal behind ``/undo act_<id>``.

REVERSIBILITY is the invariant this module upholds. ``undo_act`` reverses an act
by KIND:

* A nag act (rung 3, ``nag_*``) is reversed by marking the task acked in
  ``nag-state.json`` (``ack_type="user_undo"``) -- the Contract-3 stub
  ``autonomy_gate.ack_nag`` -- and recording the reversal in both ledgers.
* A board mutation (an act carrying a ``pre_action_snapshot`` with a ``raw_line``)
  is reversed by restoring the snapshotted line to its board file -- but NOT by
  guessing on full-line text. Content search breaks on duplicate lines and on any
  later edit (a 7-day undo window makes "the board drifted since the act" the
  common case), and a wrong-line restore silently corrupts the board. So the
  restore is re-keyed on TWO stable anchors captured at gate time (H9):

  * a board-REVISION stamp (a sha256 of the board file at snapshot time). If the
    board is byte-identical now, the stored ``line_number`` + ``raw_line`` still
    agree and we restore directly -- the fast, unambiguous path.
  * the affected task's STABLE id (the ``task_id::`` / ``id::`` inline marker the
    board line carries). When the board has drifted, we locate the target by that
    id, not by text. EXACTLY ONE match restores; ZERO or MORE-THAN-ONE candidates
    REFUSE with a structured CONFLICT (``conflict-not-found`` /
    ``conflict-duplicate`` / ``conflict-edited``) and write NOTHING -- the system
    never guesses which of two ambiguous lines to overwrite.

  ``raw_line``/``line_number`` are kept for back-compat and as a fallback hint: an
  OLD snapshot lacking the revision/id fields still undoes through the legacy
  content path (or refuses cleanly on ambiguity) -- it never crashes.

Every reversal is gated by the tiered undo window (Decision #8): 4h for nag acts,
7d for board mutations (both env-tunable via ``cos_config``). An act already
reverted, past its window, or unknown is refused with a structured reason -- never
a traceback (NO-RAW-ERROR-LEAK; the caller wraps this through U1's envelope).
