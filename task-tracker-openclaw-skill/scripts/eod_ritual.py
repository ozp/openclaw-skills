"""U4 EOD ritual -- detect, high-trust auto-write, and button-confirm.

This is the thin orchestration layer for the evening ritual's FIRST step: detect
what got done today, auto-complete only the high-trust subset when explicitly
enabled, and render the remaining detected completions with tappable Confirm
buttons. It owns NO new matching logic and NO raw board writes -- it reuses the
existing harvest/match seams and the existing
``tt:appr:<task_id>`` confirm-gate (U1's ``telegram_buttons`` builder; the U2
plugin + dispatcher already route ``appr`` -> ``harvest_ledger.approve``, which is
topic-guarded + reversible + ledger-writing).

Invariant: when ``TASK_TRACKER_HIGH_TRUST_AUTO_ENABLED`` is off, behavior remains
the tap-confirm path. When the flag is on, only externally verified exact,
unambiguous, non-recurring matches are completed via ``complete_by_id`` before
buttons are rendered; all other evidence remains tap-confirmed.

Scope boundary: this module spans detect + confirm (U4), the forced disposition (U5),
setting tomorrow's #1 (U6), AND -- as of U7 -- the live DELIVERY of the assembled ritual
through the receipt-backed seam, the human-readable Obsidian ``## EOD Summary``, the
``eod_review`` health record, and the deterministic-cron descriptor. It does NOT build
the morning-standup reader (U8). ``eod_review.py`` already parses the daily note for
done/not-done; this unit reuses the ``harvest_auto`` / ``harvest_ledger`` evidence
seams and leaves daily-note parsing to ``eod_review`` where the later EOD slices need it.

U7 -- delivery + summary + health + cron (KTD-1, KTD-5): the assembled EOD (the detect,
disposition, and tomorrow's-#1 steps' text + buttons) is delivered through the SAME
prove -> gate -> assert -> ``outbox.deliver_once`` seam the weekly digest uses
(``ledger_delivery.deliver_auto_digest``), keyed on the local DATE so a same-day re-fire
never double-sends. Delivery is not coupled to board mutation: high-trust U4 writes
already happened through ``complete_by_id`` before rendering, and all U5/U6 button
writes still happen only on taps. An env-unset / gate-blocked delivery returns a
clean reason with NO partial send, and any completed board changes already stand. On a
delivered EOD the human-readable ``## EOD Summary`` (done today / still-open / tomorrow's
#1) is upserted to the Obsidian daily note (``eod_summary``; IDEMPOTENT -- a re-run
REPLACES the section, never appends). ``run_main`` records the REAL ``eod_review`` health
success/failure (the key is already in ``cos_manifest.EXPECTED_RITUALS``). The
deterministic cron is a CODE-ONLY descriptor template (``eod_cron_descriptor``) +
shape-asserting test; live ``openclaw cron add`` registration is a deferred OPERATOR step.

U6 -- set tomorrow's #1 (the loop's WRITE side, KTD-6): the EOD proposes a #1 from the
board's priority/capacity and renders it with a "Set as tomorrow's #1" button
(``tt:top:<id>``) plus a couple of alternatives. A tap routes through the U2 dispatcher
to the ``set-top`` command, which writes ``tomorrow-pointer.json`` (the morning standup,
U8, reads it). When the board has NO open task to nominate, the EOD writes an EXPLICIT
"none" pointer here directly (there is nothing to tap), so the standup shows a clean
board rather than a stale prior-day #1. Proposing is otherwise READ-ONLY -- no pointer
is written until the user taps (mirroring the no-change-without-confirm invariant), with
the one deliberate exception of the empty-board "none" record.

U5 -- forced disposition: every task still open at EOD is rendered with a disposition
button row (``tt:done`` / ``tt:carry`` / ``tt:rsch`` / ``tt:drop``). NOTHING is
auto-mutated -- mirroring the no-change-without-confirm invariant, an un-tapped task
is REPORTED as "needs disposition", never silently carried or dropped. A tap routes
through the U2 dispatcher to the existing reversible, gated command path (``done`` /
``carry`` / ``reschedule`` / ``drop``).

Robustness: a broken harvest source (``gh``/``gog`` non-zero, a tripped circuit
breaker) is absorbed inside the harvest layer -- it returns ``source_error: True``
and yields whatever evidence the surviving sources produced (possibly none). U4
reports that as a one-line "harvest unavailable" note and STILL completes the
detect step, so a flaky source never aborts the EOD.

# into ONE Telegram message with ONE flat button grid -- Telegram cannot label or
# interleave "Done/Carry/Reschedule/Drop × N tasks", so the old mega-message collapsed
# into an unreadable grid at any N>1. Instead the EOD assembles a LIST of small,
# self-contained chunks (each its own ``message`` + ``buttons`` + ``idem_suffix``) and
# delivers each through its OWN receipt-backed ``deliver_once``, mirroring the working
# nag (``nag_check``/``nag_delivery``) one-task-per-message pattern.
#
# HARD RULE: NO chunk's ``buttons`` reference more than one ``task_id``. A disposition
# chunk carries exactly ONE task's 4-button row; a confirm chunk carries ONE task's
# Confirm; the tomorrow's-#1 chunk is the one acceptable multi-button decision (picking
# ONE #1 among ~3 candidates). The remainder is a single buttonless "+K more" line.
