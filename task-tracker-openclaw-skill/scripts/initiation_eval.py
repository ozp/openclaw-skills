"""v0.4-C initiation state-machine evaluator -- the deterministic "should we nudge?".

A PURE, rules-only evaluator (U9 discipline: no model, fail-OPEN toward silence, gates by
explicit stored facts). It reads the committed #1, the focus-session start signal, the
point-in-time calendar, and the outbox send-history, and -- if every gate passes -- emits
an expiring ``Proposal`` (``initiation_contract``) for the C4 dispatcher to re-check and
deliver. It performs NO send and NO board mutation; its only side effect (in
``decide_and_store``) is parking the proposal in the initiation store.

Gates (ALL must pass), in cheap-to-expensive order so the calendar subprocess runs LAST:
  1. a #1 is committed for today (focus-state approved, ``daily_priorities[0]``);
  2. it has NOT been started (no focus session today -- active or already ended);
  3. the task's nag is not currently snoozed;
  4. the stage/cadence allows a send now -- cold-start after >= elapsed-min; ONE re-nudge
     after >= renudge-min past the cold-start send; both capped by the daily send budget;
  5. the calendar does not say the user is busy right now (``availability.not_known_busy``).

Fail-OPEN: any read error returns ``None`` (no nudge). For a proactive send, erring toward
silence is the safe direction -- a missed nudge is harmless, an errant one is not.
