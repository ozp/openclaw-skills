"""H4 manifest + health surface: what's running, and when each ritual last ran.

Two read-only views over the machine-visible health substrate (``cos_health``):

* ``manifest`` -- writes ``cos-manifest.json`` (and prints it): a snapshot of the
  deployed skill (``skill_version`` from an optional ``VERSION``/``DEPLOY_STAMP``
  stamp file), the static list of ``enabled_units`` (U1..U5 live, U6 dormant), and
  the ``rituals`` health map (per-ritual last_success / last_failure). An external
  watchdog can poll this one file to learn the shape of the running skill.
* ``health`` -- prints a human-readable per-ritual summary, flagging any ritual whose
  ``last_success_ts`` is older than a staleness threshold (default 36h) as STALE.

Both run inside ``error_envelope.run_main`` so this script obeys the same
NO-RAW-ERROR-LEAK contract as every other ritual: a crash logs + prints one friendly
line + exits 0, never a traceback. The views are READ-ONLY over the board/state (they
only WRITE ``cos-manifest.json``, a derived artifact), so they are safe rung-0
surfaces to route from Telegram.

# until STALE). H8 wired ``ledger_harvest`` health: ``--auto`` records success on a clean
