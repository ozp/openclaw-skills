"""U1 trust boundary: the NO-RAW-ERROR-LEAK envelope.

Every tool/script failure that would otherwise surface a raw traceback,
exception class, file path, ``ModuleNotFoundError``, or a hallucinated tool name
to the Telegram channel is caught here, classified, and turned into a friendly
one-line acknowledgment ("...unavailable right now, logged..."). The full error
is recorded -- never forwarded -- to a structured JSONL error log under the
Chief-of-Staff state dir (``cos_config.state_dir()`` -> Decision #6, NOT the
OpenClaw-managed agent dir which rotates on upgrade).

Contract for every Chief-of-Staff Python script (Phase 0a/U1 §3d):

1. Wrap the ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` body in ``run_main()`` (or a manual
   top-level ``try/except Exception`` that calls ``handle_fatal``).
2. On an uncaught exception: log it here, print ONE friendly line to STDOUT
   (never stderr, never a traceback), and exit 0 so the agent relay does not see
   a non-zero exit and forward raw output.
3. Never print a Python exception class, file path, or line number to stdout.

The module is also a CLI (``error_envelope.py log-subprocess ...``) so the shell
wrapper ``telegram-commands.sh`` can log a failed subprocess's captured stderr
without ever echoing it to stdout.

    R1 Fix 1 -- health is recorded from the RESULT CODE, not merely exception-vs-not.
    A ritual can FAIL without raising: it can catch the failure itself and ``return 1``
    (the nag engine does exactly this when a per-task transport failure was swallowed
    into a ``blocked`` count). A handled-but-failed ritual is NOT healthy, so a NONZERO

    raised exception would -- otherwise H4's health substrate false-greens on a soft
    failure. A ``0``/``None`` result records ``record_success``.

    CRITICAL exit-0 contract (UNCHANGED): a soft failure must NOT make the cron relay
    see a non-zero exit and forward raw output. So in the nonzero case we record the
    health failure and STILL ``return 0`` to the OS -- the health signal is the
    machine-visible failure, the exit code stays the friendly exit-0. (A raised
    exception likewise records a failure and returns 0.) Health recording is best-effort
    throughout: a raising recorder is swallowed and can never change the exit code or
    stdout -- the H4 wrap.

    ``SystemExit`` from argparse (``--help``, bad args) is re-raised untouched so
    CLI ergonomics are preserved; only genuine exceptions are enveloped.

    There is no missing-tool breaker at this layer: a top-level ritual that
    raises does so as a Python exception, not a repeated missing-tool subprocess
    loop. The breaker lives where the actual loop risk is -- ``get_calendar_events``
    short-circuits on an open ``calendar_fetch`` breaker so a missing ``gog`` does
