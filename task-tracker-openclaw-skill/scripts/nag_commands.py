"""U4 reactive command handlers: /done /reschedule /snooze + body-double.

These run inside the user's interactive turn (origin-proven -- they reply in the
topic the command arrived in, no proactive push), so they do NOT go through the
proactive delivery seam.  Their job is to mutate the board (via the existing
``task_transitions`` write path) and then close / pause the nag loop
SYNCHRONOUSLY in the SAME turn -- the ADHD-trust requirement (Decision/Verdict
mustFix #4): if /done returned but the nag re-fired 3h later because the
background loop had not yet noticed, that is a trust kill.

Command summary:

* ``/done <id>``        -- complete the task, then close the loop (explicit_done).
* ``/reschedule <id> <date>`` -- move ``due::``, then close the loop (rescheduled).
* ``/snooze <id> <dur>`` -- pause the loop until now+dur; akrasia re-prompt + a
  hard cap of 3 snoozes (the 4th is REFUSED, loop unchanged).
* ``/body-double <id> <dur>`` -- start a focus session with two ephemeral
  (``deleteAfterRun:true``) check-in crons, each carrying an explicit proven
  ``delivery.to`` + ``agentId``.  Refuses a task not on the active board, and a
  second concurrent session for the same task.
* ``/start <id> [<min>] [next: <cue>]`` (H7) -- the initiation loop: REUSES the
  body-double focus-session machinery (``_open_focus_session``) and layers on a
  resumption CUE stored on the session, a QUIET window for the session duration
  (H5), and an end-of-session done/continue/blocked/redefine DISPOSITION prompt.
  ``/start`` (no task) / ``/start status`` shows the active session's cue.
* ``/cancel-session <id>`` -- end the LIVE focus/body-double session + delete its
  pending crons, and RELEASE only THIS session's quiet lease (R3). A manual
  ``/quiet`` (its own lease) and any other session's lease are untouched, so a
  shorter OR longer manual ``/quiet`` survives the block's end with no restore step.

The body-double ephemeral crons use ``deleteAfterRun: true`` so the gateway reaps
them after they fire -- the agent never issues a ``cron rm`` (orphan risk if a
fire is missed).

      the resumption cue -- the ``next:`` marker is an OPTIONAL separator, never
      required: both ``/start tsk finish the slides`` and ``/start tsk next: finish
      the slides`` capture the cue. (Silently dropping a marker-less cue was a
      footgun: ``/start`` exists to capture the next action at the moment of
      friction, so the user's own phrasing must not be discarded.) The marker still
      earns its keep as an escape so a cue whose first word looks like a duration
