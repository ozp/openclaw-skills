"""U4 nag-state I/O layer (Contract 3): the single source of truth for open loops.

``nag-state.json`` (under ``cos_config.state_dir()``) is keyed by ``task_id``.
An entry with ``ack: false`` MEANS the nag loop is open; ``ack: true`` is terminal
for a loop (only a NEW ``nag_loop_id`` reactivates a task -- the old loop is moved
to ``archived_nag_loops``). This module owns every read/modify/write of that file
so both the background cron (``nag_check.py``) and the reactive command path
(``nag_commands.py``) mutate it through one flock-guarded, atomic-write code path.

Why a sidecar lockfile + atomic write (not ``.write_text``): overlapping
heartbeats / a reactive ``/done`` racing the cron would otherwise read the same
base state, each add their own entry, and the last writer's ``os.replace`` drops
every other writer's entry (lost update). ``transition()`` serialises the whole
read-modify-write cycle on a sidecar lock so every concurrent writer survives, and
``_atomic_write`` (temp+replace+fsync) prevents a torn write from corrupting the
file mid-heartbeat.

This module makes NO board write and sends NO Telegram push -- it is pure state.
The push/proof plumbing lives in ``nag_check.py``; the board mutations live in the
reactive command handlers that call ``task_transitions``.
