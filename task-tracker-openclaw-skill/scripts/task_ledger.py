    The cutoff is ``now - max(ledger_retention_days, board undo window)``. Taking
    the MAX is the load-bearing safety rule: ``events.jsonl`` is the audit/undo
    substrate (``/audit`` + ``/undo`` resolve a board mutation by replaying its
    ``pre_action_snapshot`` / ``evidence_link`` / revert events, and a pending
    ``/approve`` references the harvest events), so an event INSIDE the board undo
    window (7d default) must never be pruned even if a misconfigured retention is
    shorter. Retention can shrink the kept history but NEVER below the window in
    which an event is still operationally needed.

    Known edge (v0.3): the completion-candidate inbox projects a candidate's summary
    from its seed ``candidate_seen`` event. A candidate snoozed UNBOUNDEDLY (past the
    retention window, default 90d) can have its seed pruned while a newer snooze event
    survives, so it resurfaces with no summary -- degraded display, never data loss or
    a leak. A complete fix (carry the summary forward on each snooze, or a
    candidate-aware prune) is deferred to v0.3 rather than coupling this prune to live
    candidate state; 90d of un-acted snooze is itself the more pressing signal.
