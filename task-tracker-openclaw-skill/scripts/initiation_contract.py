"""v0.4-C initiation decision-contract: the episode slot, the expiring proposal,
and the send-time compare-and-swap (CAS).

This is the *contract* half of the initiation nudge -- the data shapes and the
read-only validity check that the C3 evaluator and the C4 dispatcher share. It
holds NO send logic (the dispatcher delivers via ``outbox.deliver_once``) and
performs NO mutation; it only defines identities and answers "is this proposal
still safe to act on?".

Three pieces:

* ``focus_episode_slot`` -- the deterministic committed-#1 EPISODE identity. A
  cold-start initiation nudge ("you said X was today's #1, it's 2pm, not started
  -- Start it?") fires BEFORE any focus session exists, so there is no
  ``nag_state`` ``session_id`` to key on at decision time. The slot
  ``<user_scope>:<task_id>:<local_date>`` exists the moment the user commits a #1
  for the day, is identical across the treatment and the 25%-holdout arms, and the
  ``nag_state`` session (when the user finally taps Start) binds to it. This is the
  ``focus_episode_id`` in the outbox key ``initiation:<focus_episode_id>:<stage>``
  -- ``user_scope`` is carried INSIDE the slot, realising the checkpoint's
  ``(user_scope, focus_episode_id, stage)`` tuple without duplicating scope as a
  separate key segment.

* ``Proposal`` -- the expiring proposal the evaluator writes (and the store
  persists). It snapshots the two CAS tokens at write time: ``cas_focus_state_rev``
  (the monotonic ``focus_state.rev`` -- the committed-#1 / priorities version) and
  ``cas_no_session_since`` (the instant after which ANY focus-session start/end for
  the task invalidates the proposal). ``arm`` is filled by C5 (the holdout); it is
  ``None`` here.

* ``cas_still_valid`` -- the pure two-dimension check the dispatcher runs INSIDE the
  outbox flock immediately before sending. It defends against STALE STATE (not
  injection -- injection is handled by the dispatcher rendering inert templates with
  escaped titles and no raw body). It compares (1) the current ``focus_state.rev``
  against the snapshot (the user re-prioritised / approved / vetoed -> abort) and
  (2) whether any focus session for the task started or ended since the baseline
  (the user already started -> abort). ``cas_still_valid_now`` reads live state and
  fails CLOSED on any read error.
