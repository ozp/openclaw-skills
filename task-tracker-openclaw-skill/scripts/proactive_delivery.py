"""U6 delivery seam: the SINGLE proactive-push path for every brief + debrief.

Hard Gate #4 (DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF): no proactive push may send without proving
its exact destination FIRST. Every U6 push -- daily brief, pre-brief, debrief
prompt, slip notification, Friday proposal -- funnels through ``prove_and_gate``
here so the proof chain is identical and tested once, exactly like U4's
``nag_delivery``:

    1. ``prove_delivery_target(chat_id, topic_id)`` -- env-assembled allowlist,
       Work-group reject, env-missing block (Contract 2). An unset env / wrong
       group returns BLOCKED -- never a guessed target.
    2. ``autonomy_gate.gate(act_type, delivery_target=...)`` -- re-proves the
       target INSIDE the gate and returns an ``act_id`` bound to it.
    3. ``autonomy_gate.assert_send_target(act_id, target)`` -- the gate<->message
       seam: the gated target is the SOLE permitted destination.

Order (mustFix #5): resolve+PROVE the delivery target FIRST -- before any freebusy
or calendar work -- so a push to an unprovable target is blocked before anything
is computed, and the proven target is what every message lands on. On a proof
failure the caller logs ``delivery_target_proof_failed`` and sends NOTHING; on
success it logs ``delivery_target_resolved`` immediately before the send.

The Friday proposal targets the WEEKLY_REVIEW_PLANNING topic (4); every other push
targets the STANDUP topic (2). Both are env-sourced and proven the same way.
