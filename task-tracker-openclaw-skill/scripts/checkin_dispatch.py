"""V1 deterministic check-in dispatcher: fire a focus/body-double check-in as TEXT.

Oracle O3 HIGH-2 (a live gap in deployed code): ``/start`` and ``/body-double``
scheduled their halfway/end check-ins as one-shot crons carrying an ``agentId`` +
``prompt``. Per OpenClaw's cron model that is a fresh MODEL-BACKED agent turn --
``announce`` is only fallback delivery AFTER the turn, and the agent can still use
``message`` / default tools. The user's free-text resumption CUE was spliced into
that prompt by ``_disposition_prompt``, so untrusted user text entered an LLM
instruction channel = a prompt-injection surface. The cron also reused a delivery
target proven at SESSION-CREATION time (never re-validated at fire time) and could
fire AFTER the user had ``/done``'d or cancelled the task.

The fix is to schedule a deterministic COMMAND cron that runs THIS dispatcher at
fire time (no LLM turn). The session identity arrives as ARGV -- never interpolated
into any prompt. At fire time the dispatcher:

1. Reloads nag-state and looks up the session via
   ``nag_state.active_body_double_session(entry, now=...)``. If the session is NOT
   active (ended / ``/done``'d / cancelled / elapsed-expired / not found) it sends
   NOTHING and exits clean -- a post-``/done`` check-in is a no-op.
2. RE-PROVES the delivery target NOW (the same ``nag_delivery.resolve_target`` path
   ``_open_focus_session`` uses) -- it never trusts a target baked in at create
   time (DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF, Hard Gate #4). An unprovable target records a
   health/error and sends nothing -- never a send to an unproven target.
3. Renders the check-in / end-of-session disposition as INERT templated TEXT (the
   cue appears only as displayed text, never as an instruction to a model) and
   passes it through ``redaction.redact_message`` as the H10 length backstop.
4. Delivers via ``outbox.deliver_once`` -> ``openclaw_sender`` (receipt-backed,
   idempotent), keyed on ``(session_id, halfway|end)`` so a cron RETRY of the same
   phase can never double-send.

NO-RAW-ERROR-LEAK: ``main`` runs under ``error_envelope.run_main`` so any crash is
logged + health-recorded and exits 0 with a friendly line (never a traceback).
