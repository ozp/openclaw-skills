"""Autonomy gate + audit-log substrate (Contracts 3 & 4, Decision #1).

Phase 0a scaffolding. This module lands the *contracts* every autonomous writer
(U2-U6) codes against, plus the security-grade gate<->message seam (Decision #1):

* ``gate(...)`` records an act in the autonomy log and returns an ``act_id`` bound
  to a single proven ``delivery_target``. The pre-action snapshot is taken INSIDE
  ``gate()`` immediately before the write is authorised (TOCTOU fix), not at
  proposal time.
* ``assert_send_target(act_id, attempted_target)`` is the seam: a later send for
  that ``act_id`` MUST use the identical gated target or it is blocked. Full
  ``message()`` wiring is U4; here we land the helper + the denied-path contract.

State files (all under ``cos_config.state_dir()`` == ~/.lobster/state/task-mgmt):

* ``autonomy-log.jsonl``  -- append-only act log (Contract 4 shape).
* ``autonomy-config.json``-- the rung ladder + default_rung_for_unknown.
* ``nag-state.json``      -- frozen Contract 3 shape; minimal safe stub so a future
  ``/undo`` of a nag won't crash before U4 exists.

Every writer here is atomic (utils._atomic_write) and flock-guarded.
