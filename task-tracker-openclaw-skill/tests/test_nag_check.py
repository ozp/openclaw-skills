"""U4 nag engine: NAG-CLOSES-ONLY-ON-ACK + DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF + REVERSIBILITY.

These tests assert the unit INVARIANTS on the denied paths, not just the happy
path:

* NAG-CLOSES-ONLY-ON-ACK -- a crash mid-run leaves the loop open; a delivery block
  (unset env / work group) leaves the loop OPEN and never silently clears; a
  snooze pauses but does not close; only /done /reschedule / verified-done close.
* DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF -- no push without a proven, gated, asserted target; an
  unset env => nag_delivery_blocked:env_missing, zero sends.
* REVERSIBILITY -- the board file is never written by the nag engine (mtime
  unchanged after every run).

Fake chat ids: valid chat-id shape (^-?\\d+$) but NOT matching the public-hygiene
grep (-100[0-9]{8,}); real ids are env-sourced, never committed.
