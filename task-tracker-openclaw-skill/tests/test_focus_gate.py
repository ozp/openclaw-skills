"""U3 write-time cap gate + H6 capture-never-blocks + standup capacity display.

The gate at ``add_task()`` is the Layer-2 enforcement point. H6 changed what
HAPPENS when the active set is full: capture NEVER blocks. An over-cap add now
ALWAYS succeeds and is routed to the parking lot (the inbox) instead of landing on
the active board, so a commitment is never pushed out of the system. The cap now
gates PROMOTION onto the active board (see ``test_focus_promote_swap.py``), not
capture. These tests pin that an over-cap add does NOT bloat the active set -- it
lands in parking -- and that a real capture FAILURE (lot full) still exits nonzero.
