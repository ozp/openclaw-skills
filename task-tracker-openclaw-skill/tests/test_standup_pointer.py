"""U8 consolidated morning standup -- behavioral invariant tests.

These assert the U8 invariants, not the implementation path:

* OPENS WITH TOMORROW'S #1 (the load-bearing piece): the standup's FIRST content line
  resolves the U6 tomorrow-pointer against the LIVE board and shows it as today's #1.
* DEGRADES CLEANLY, NEVER CRASHES: no pointer / an explicit "none" pointer -> "no #1 set
  -- pick one"; a since-completed (off-board) pointer -> "pick a fresh one". A standup
  must never blow up because the pointer is missing or stale.
* DETERMINISTIC COMMAND CRON: the 8am cron descriptor is ``payload.kind == "command"``
  running ``telegram-commands.sh daily`` and announcing to the Productivity STANDUP
  thread -- asserted on the descriptor JSON (CODE-ONLY; no live ``openclaw cron add``).
* PARITY (KTD-5): the ``daily`` standup output still covers the board / priorities /
  blockers the legacy Lobster standup surfaced -- the fields the user relies on (the
  ledger supersedes the legacy Obsidian audit blocks, which are NOT reproduced).

Public-repo hygiene: the only chat id here is the FAKE ``-4242424242`` (does NOT match
the ``-100[0-9]{8,}`` pattern the CI hygiene grep flags). Task ids are fake ``tsk_*``.
