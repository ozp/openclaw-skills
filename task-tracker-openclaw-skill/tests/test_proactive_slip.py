"""U6 slip recovery + debrief follow-up: NEVER-OVERBOOK-EXTERNAL through the flow.

Asserts the unit invariant on the slip path (the cron flow, not just the
calendar_blocks unit):

* a slipped agent-owned block slides via gog UPDATE (never delete+create) and the
  state persists atomically (T5);
* a freebusy-unknown / busy new window REFUSES the move, logs
  calendar_block_refused, and leaves the block in place (NEVER-OVERBOOK-EXTERNAL);
* a debrief follow-up re-prompts an OPEN loop after the event ends but never closes
  it (NAG-CLOSES-ONLY-ON-ACK).
