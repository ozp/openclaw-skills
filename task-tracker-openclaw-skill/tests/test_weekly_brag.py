"""H8 weekly brag digest + /win capture -- behavioral invariant tests.

Pins the four DONE invariants of H8, asserting the behavior (not the code path):

1. AUTO-HARVEST IS WEEKLY + SILENT WHEN EMPTY. The proactive (cron) push fires only
   on Friday AND only when the digest has content; an empty digest sends NOTHING (no
   blank message). On-demand /ledger works any day.
2. /win FRICTIONLESS CAPTURE. A win is appended with no cap/validation gate, persists
   durably (survives a crash -- a fresh read sees it), and surfaces in a later digest.
3. FOUR-BUCKET DIGEST. The digest renders shipped / advanced / decisions / maintenance,
   classifying harvested evidence and routing manual /win items into the right bucket.
4. R1 HEALTH WIRING. A cron (--auto) harvest records ledger_harvest health (success on
   a clean run, failure on ok:false), the manifest shows it as recently-succeeded (not
   MISSING); a reactive /ledger records NO health (no cron-vs-reactive conflation).

Public-repo hygiene: the only chat ids here are the FAKEs -4242424242 / -5252525252,
which do NOT match the -100[0-9]{8,} pattern the CI hygiene grep flags.
