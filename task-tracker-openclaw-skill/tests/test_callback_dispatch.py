"""U2 inline-button RECEIVE half: callback_dispatch behavioral invariants.

These assert the invariants, not the implementation path:

* DECODE IS THE TRUST BOUNDARY: a forged / over-budget / unknown-action / wrong-namespace
  callback never reaches a command -- it returns a clean ``undecodable`` result, not a crash.
* HAPPY PATH: a ``tt:done:<id>`` tap runs the EXISTING command and mutates the board through
  the reversible path (the task leaves the active board; an ``ok:true`` result is returned).
* STALE TAP: a tap on an already-actioned task returns a clean structured result
  (``canonical-id-resolution-failed``), NEVER a traceback -- the board is not written twice.
* ONE AUTH POINT (KTD-4): an ``appr`` tap from the WRONG topic is rejected by the downstream
  topic guard (``wrong-topic``); the dispatcher adds no bypass and authorizes nothing itself.
* RESCHEDULE: a bare ``rsch`` (no date) is ``needs_date`` (no board change); ``rsch:<date>``
  reschedules through the existing command (closes the R7 two-step-reschedule UX in one tap).
* NO RAW ERROR LEAK: a malformed args JSON surfaces as a friendly one line + exit 0, never a
  traceback (the error_envelope.run_main boundary).
* U5 DISPOSITION: a decodable ``carry`` / ``drop`` tap routes to the new nag_commands verbs and
  mutates the board through the existing reversible path (carry keeps it active + stamps carried::;
  drop moves it to the parking lot).
* U6 SET-TOP: a decodable ``top`` tap routes to the ``set-top`` verb, which writes the
  tomorrow-pointer the morning standup reads (no board mutation).

Public-repo hygiene: the only chat/topic ids here are FAKE values that do NOT match the
-100[0-9]{8,} pattern the CI hygiene grep flags. Real ids are env-sourced at runtime.
