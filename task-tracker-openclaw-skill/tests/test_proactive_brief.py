"""U6 proactive brief/debrief flows + the DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF denied path.

Hard Gate #5 (DELIVERY-SEAM): every U6 push goes through prove_delivery_target()
+ the gated act_id (assert_send_target). These tests assert the invariant on the
DENIED paths, not just the happy path:

* DELIVERY-TARGET-PROOF -- order is "resolve+prove FIRST, then send". An unset env
  / a Work-group target blocks the push; NOTHING is delivered;
  delivery_target_proof_failed is logged; no delivery_target_resolved is logged.
* NEVER-OVERBOOK-EXTERNAL (via slip) -- slip recovery refuses to move a block into
  a busy/unknown window (logs calendar_block_refused) and never delete+creates.
* idempotency -- the daily brief / Friday proposal send at most once per day.

Fake chat ids: valid chat-id shape but NOT matching -100[0-9]{8,}; real ids are
env-sourced, never committed (mirrors test_delivery_target.py).
