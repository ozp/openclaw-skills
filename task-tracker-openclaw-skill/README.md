# Task Tracker Skill for OpenClaw

Personal task management with daily standups and weekly reviews.

## Documentation Map

- **`SKILL.md`**: lean runtime entrypoint (when to use, quick start, core commands)
- **`references/setup-and-config.md`**: environment variables, defaults, troubleshooting
- **`references/commands.md`**: full command catalog
- **`references/obsidian-and-dataview.md`**: Obsidian patterns and Dataview snippets
- **`references/eod-sync.md`**: EOD sync and weekly embed refresh
- **`references/migration.md`**: migration + legacy compatibility notes
- **`references/task-format.md`**: legacy task format specification
- **`TELEGRAM.md`**: optional Telegram slash command setup

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kesslerio/task-tracker-openclaw-skill.git <workspace>/<skill>
cd <workspace>/<skill>

# Required for work workflows
export TASK_TRACKER_WORK_FILE="$HOME/path/to/Work Tasks.md"

# Required only for --personal commands
export TASK_TRACKER_PERSONAL_FILE="$HOME/path/to/Personal Tasks.md"

python3 scripts/tasks.py list
python3 scripts/standup.py
python3 scripts/weekly_review.py
```

## What this skill provides

- Task list/add/done workflows for work and personal boards
- Canonical task identity audit/repair with inline `task_id::` metadata
- Append-only JSONL event ledger for repairs and ID-based completions
- Durable completion evidence inbox for review/confirm/reject/snooze decisions
- Read-only task health audits for duplicate titles, stale tasks, identity
  issues, candidates, and backlog pressure
- Daily standup summaries (`standup.py`, `personal_standup.py`) — the work standup
  opens with the EOD-set tomorrow's #1
- **Priority-first nag** that chases today's committed priorities (with a Start
  initiation button), not just worst-overdue
- **EOD ritual** (`telegram-commands.sh eod`): detect-done → confirm → disposition
  every open task → set tomorrow's #1, feeding the board, ledger, a tomorrow-pointer,
  and an Obsidian `## EOD Summary`
- **Inline-button UX**: nags, EOD, and disposition are tappable (`tt:` gateway
  plugin → existing deterministic commands) instead of copy-paste task IDs
- Weekly review + archive workflows (`weekly_review.py`, `archive.py`)
- Backlog and delegated-task hygiene
- Action extraction from notes (`extract_tasks.py`)
- End-of-day evidence reporting retained, with legacy Weekly TODO writes behind
  `--apply`
- Weekly transclusion refresh for Obsidian (`update_weekly_embeds.py`)

## Compatibility

Active task mutations now require canonical `task_id::` values. Legacy title
matching remains useful for read-only review and migration diagnostics, but
write paths block when they cannot resolve exactly one canonical task.
Fallback IDs may appear in JSON output for diagnostics; they are not valid
mutation targets.

Completion evidence candidates are suggestions stored in the ledger. Scanning
daily-log/EOD-style evidence never changes active tasks. Candidate confirmation
uses the same canonical-ID completion path as `tasks.py done`.

Chat capture uses a two-lane trust model. **Free-form chat prose never
auto-writes** — every raw `tasks.py capture --text "..."` message becomes a
one-tap candidate (the extractor only ranks/prefills the suggested task; it is
not an authorization boundary). Conversational chat completion writes happen
**only** when the owner taps an inline `tt:done:<task_id>` button posted by the
OpenClaw completion assistant. A leading completion phrase such as `done the
JAMS thing` resolves against open, non-recurring, non-objective tasks and posts a
confirm/disambiguation prompt; the prose itself never mutates the board. The
assistant also owns the chat-scope gate; `tasks.py --personal capture ...` is
refused.

Candidate JSON distinguishes direct confirmation from suggestions:
`confirmable_task_id` appears only for exact canonical ID/link evidence.
Title, fuzzy, fallback, and normalized-title evidence expose `suggested_match`
and still require an explicit canonical `--task-id`. Standup, EOD, weekly, and
workflow-control surfaces may show candidate counts and IDs, but they must not
auto-complete tasks. Gmail, calendar, and session-log evidence ingestion remains
deferred.

Periodic task audits are also read-only. They surface task-health findings and
safe next actions, but they do not freeze, delete, merge, complete, or otherwise
mutate tasks.

## Development

```bash
# run tests
pytest -q

# enforce public-repo hygiene (paths, IDs, and default examples)
bash scripts/ci/check-public-hygiene.sh
```

If a hygiene match is intentional, add a targeted allowlist entry in
`scripts/ci/public-hygiene-allowlist.txt` using one of:

- `RULE|path/to/file`
- `RULE|path/to/file:line`
