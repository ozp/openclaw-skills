# Task Tracker

Personal task management for work + personal workflows, with daily standups and
weekly reviews.

Source-of-truth model: active task boards are the current task state. Daily and
weekly notes are logs/evidence, not canonical task state. The JSONL sidecar
ledger is audit/candidate history for identity repairs, ID-based completions,
and completion evidence decisions.

## Board mutation rule (CRITICAL — never hand-edit the board)

The work board (`Weekly TODOs.md` / `TASK_TRACKER_WORK_FILE`) is mutated **only**
through the task-tracker scripts. Never hand-create, overwrite, or hand-edit it
with a file `write`/`edit`/`apply_patch` tool or shell `sed` — doing so strips
`task_id::` metadata, creates duplicate task representations (a metadata-bearing
section plus a bare "All Tasks" copy), and resurrects ledger-closed tasks as open,
corrupting every standup, nag, and weekly review downstream.

- **Add / complete / reschedule / cancel:** `python3 scripts/tasks.py add|done|reschedule|remove`
  (assigns and preserves the canonical `task_id::`). `remove` cancels a task by
  canonical id — it records a cancellation, not a completion (no `✅`, not counted
  in done/velocity).
- **Weekly rollover (creating the new week's board):** `python3 scripts/rollover.py`
  — the deterministic, ledger-aware rollover. It carries forward open tasks with
  their `task_id::` intact, never re-lists a ledger-closed task as open, and emits
  one canonical priority-sectioned board (no duplicate "All Tasks" section). **Do
  NOT** "compile the open tasks from last week" into a new board by hand — that is
  exactly what corrupts it.
- **One-time cleanup of an already-corrupted board** (dual representation, missing
  IDs, resurrected-done): `python3 scripts/reconcile_board.py` (dry-run by default;
  `--apply --repair` to write).

If a board operation isn't covered by these scripts, surface it as a gap — do not
improvise with a raw file write.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Run a daily or personal standup
- Run a weekly review
- Add, list, update, or complete tasks
- Check blockers or due dates
- Extract actions from meeting notes
- Report completed daily items against weekly todos without changing canonical
  task state
- Review completion evidence candidates before confirming task completion
- Schedule freebusy-gated focus blocks for the day's priorities on an agent-owned
  "Task Focus" calendar, send a morning brief / pre-brief / debrief, and propose
  next week's priorities on Friday (U6 proactive layer; opt-in — degrades silently
  when the focus calendar / `STANDUP_CALENDARS` are absent and never overbooks)

## Proactive layer (U6)

`scripts/proactive_brief.py --mode {brief,prebrief,slip,friday,create}` is the cron
entry point for the proactive layer, plus `--mode debrief-capture --event-key <id>
--notes "<notes>"` for the reactive `/debrief` path. Every push proves its delivery
target FIRST (`prove_delivery_target` -> gated `act_id` -> `assert_send_target`) and
lands only on the proven Productivity topic; an unset/wrong target blocks the push
and sends nothing.

- `create` places freebusy-gated focus blocks for the day's Defended Three (read
  from U3's `focus-state.json`, never written by U6); `slip` slides a slipped block
  to the next free window and notifies the user.
- Calendar writes go through `scripts/calendar_blocks.py`, which freebusy-gates
  every create/move against EXTERNAL calendars (an overlap OR an unknown freebusy
  refuses the write — NEVER-OVERBOOK-EXTERNAL), slides a slipped block via
  `gog calendar update` (never delete+create), and refuses to delete/move any
  non-`agent_created` event (`ExternalEventError`).
- State lives in `focus-calendar.json` and `proactive-state.json` (atomic,
  torn-read safe — no duplicate briefs on a `*/5` scan; reactive `/debrief` capture
  is idempotent on a closed loop).

## Quick Start

Prefer environment-based configuration first, then run scripts from `<workspace>/<skill>`.

### 1) Configure paths (env-first)

```bash
# Required for work task workflows
export TASK_TRACKER_WORK_FILE="$HOME/path/to/Work Tasks.md"

# Required only for --personal commands
export TASK_TRACKER_PERSONAL_FILE="$HOME/path/to/Personal Tasks.md"

# Optional
export TASK_TRACKER_ARCHIVE_DIR="$HOME/path/to/archive"
export TASK_TRACKER_LEGACY_FILE="$HOME/path/to/TASKS.md"
export TASK_TRACKER_DAILY_NOTES_DIR="$HOME/path/to/Daily"
export TASK_TRACKER_WEEKLY_TODOS="$HOME/path/to/Weekly TODOs.md"
```

Defaults exist, but explicit env vars are recommended for portability.

### 2) Run from the skill directory

```bash
cd <workspace>/<skill>
# Example: cd ~/projects/skills/shared/task-tracker
```

### 3) Core commands

```bash
# Work
python3 scripts/tasks.py list
python3 scripts/standup.py
python3 scripts/weekly_review.py

# Personal
python3 scripts/tasks.py --personal list
python3 scripts/personal_standup.py
```

## Core Commands

### Task listing and filtering

```bash
python3 scripts/tasks.py list
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --plain
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --priority high
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --due today
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --due this-week
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --area openclaw
python3 scripts/tasks.py list --search backup
python3 scripts/tasks.py blockers
```

`list` emits markdown pipe tables by default, grouped by section. Use `--plain`
for legacy line-by-line output when piping the result into another script.

### Add and complete tasks

```bash
python3 scripts/tasks.py add "Draft proposal" --priority high --due 2026-01-23
python3 scripts/tasks.py --personal add "Call mom" --priority high --due 2026-01-22
python3 scripts/tasks.py identity-audit
python3 scripts/tasks.py task-audit
python3 scripts/tasks.py identity-repair --apply
python3 scripts/tasks.py done "tsk_example"
python3 scripts/tasks.py --personal done "tsk_personal"
python3 scripts/tasks.py completion-candidates scan --file /tmp/done-log.md
python3 scripts/tasks.py completion-candidates list
python3 scripts/tasks.py completion-candidates confirm cand_example --task-id tsk_example
python3 scripts/completion_inbox_control.py list
python3 scripts/completion_inbox_control.py confirm cand_example --task-id tsk_example
```

Completion candidates are evidence suggestions. Scanning does not mutate active
tasks; confirmation must resolve to a canonical `task_id::`. Workflow wrappers
such as Telegram/Lobster should call `completion_inbox_control.py` or the
`completion-candidates` command group by candidate ID. They must not call
`done` by title, fuzzy match, fallback ID, quick ID, or list position.

Task audits are read-only health checks. They can flag duplicate titles, stale
active tasks, unresolved candidates, missing IDs, and backlog pressure, but they
must not be treated as authority to freeze, delete, merge, or complete tasks.

### Daily Priorities + capacity cap (Focus Core)

Two layers (Decision #7):

- **Layer 1 — Daily Top Priorities.** Each morning the agent proposes 2-3
  must-do-today priorities (veto/approve). This is a *selection* over active
  tasks; it surfaces and chases, it does not limit how many tasks exist.
- **Layer 2 — Active-inventory cap.** `tasks add` is gated at write time: when the
  active board's estimate-sum exceeds `WEEKLY_CAPACITY_HOURS` (default 25h;
  unestimated tasks counted at `UNESTIMATED_TASK_HOURS`=2h) OR the active count
  exceeds `ACTIVE_TASK_HARD_CAP` (default 20), a new add is blocked and nudged to
  the parking lot. It NEVER force-evicts existing tasks. `--force-parking` routes
  an over-cap add to the parking lot.

```bash
# /focus*  → propose / approve / veto / override / status
python3 scripts/focus_commands.py focus
python3 scripts/focus_commands.py approve
python3 scripts/focus_commands.py veto 2
python3 scripts/focus_commands.py override
python3 scripts/focus_commands.py status

# Capacity cap on add (blocks before the board write when over capacity)
python3 scripts/tasks.py add "New task"                 # blocked when over cap
python3 scripts/tasks.py add "New task" --force-parking  # route to parking lot
```

Map `/focus`, `/focus-approve`, `/focus-veto <N>`, `/focus-override`, and
`/focus-status` to these subcommands. The cap is date-independent (it governs
total active load, not today's plan), so it applies even if the morning ritual is
skipped; `focus-state.json` (Layer-1) is re-proposed each day.

### Backlog ops

```bash
python3 scripts/tasks.py promote-from-backlog --cap 3
python3 scripts/tasks.py review-backlog --stale-days 45 --json
```

### Standup and review

```bash
python3 scripts/standup.py
python3 scripts/standup.py --compact-json
python3 scripts/personal_standup.py
python3 scripts/weekly_review.py
```

### Extraction and automation helpers

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --from-text "Meeting notes..."
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh daily
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh standup   # alias of daily
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh weekly
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh done24h
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh done7d
bash scripts/task-shortcuts.sh tasks     # quick priorities view
```

### Karakeep inbox triage

Use these commands when links are reviewed from the Karakeep `Todo` list and
must either complement an existing task, create a new task, or be routed to
`Review`.

```bash
python3 scripts/read_link.py read-bookmark --bookmark-id BOOKMARK_ID
python3 scripts/karakeep_triage.py review-inbox --limit 5
python3 scripts/karakeep_triage.py classify-bookmark --bookmark-id BOOKMARK_ID
python3 scripts/karakeep_triage.py route-item --bookmark-id BOOKMARK_ID
python3 scripts/karakeep_triage.py route-item --bookmark-id BOOKMARK_ID --apply
python3 scripts/karakeep_cron_worker.py --state-file /home/ozp/clawd/agents/karakeep/memory/cron-state.json
python3 scripts/karakeep_cron_summary.py --state-file /home/ozp/clawd/agents/karakeep/memory/cron-state.json --threshold 5 --human
```

Rules:

- `read_link.py` is the mandatory pre-classification reader.
- `review-inbox` is read-only and bounded to a small slice.
- `route-item` is dry-run by default; require `--apply` for mutation.
- Default behavior is deterministic baseline plus semantic check through
  LiteLLM/FreeLLMAPI, with disagreement biased to `Review`.
- Use `--deterministic-only` for the conservative control path.
- Destination bookmark-state lists are `Incorporated` and `Review`; the inbox
  list is `Todo`.
- The implemented reader chain is `karakeep -> github_api -> fetch/trafilatura`.
- For scheduled/background processing, keep the worker bounded to one inbox item
  per run and accumulate announcements through the cron state file.

### EOD sync + weekly embed refresh

```bash
python3 scripts/eod_sync.py --dry-run
python3 scripts/eod_sync.py
python3 scripts/eod_sync.py --apply   # legacy Weekly TODO checkbox write only
python3 scripts/update_weekly_embeds.py --dry-run
python3 scripts/update_weekly_embeds.py
```

### Autonomy audit + undo (U2 — 🧭 Identity topic 1909)

Reactive, owner-only commands that inspect or reverse a prior autonomous act.
Both reply in-topic (origin-proven) and never push to Telegram themselves.

```bash
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh audit            # list recent autonomous acts
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh audit act_<id>   # full detail for one act
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh undo act_<id>    # reverse a reversible act
```

- `/undo act_<id>` — undo a recent autonomous act (tiered window: 4h for a nag
  ack, 7d for a board mutation). A board mutation is restored by re-inserting the
  snapshot's exact `raw_line` via content search (not a line-number guess), so it
  survives other edits to the board; a `nag_sent` act is undone by acking the nag
  loop (`ack_type=user_undo`) so it will not re-fire.
- `/audit` — list recent autonomous acts (act_id, type, task, target, status),
  newest first; an already-undone act is flagged.

As of v0.2 (U4), rung-3 proactive Telegram pushes are ENABLED at the gate
(`autonomy_gate.RUNG3_PUSH_ENABLED=True`): a nag push executes only with a PROVEN,
gated, asserted delivery target. The proof is unchanged — an unset env / wrong
group / mismatched send is still blocked. Boot preflight (U1) must keep
`autonomy-log.jsonl` writable for these.

### Accountability / nag engine (U4 + U10 priority-first — Productivity Group)

The nag engine chases overdue tasks until they are acknowledged. A nag is an open
loop persisted in `nag-state.json`; it closes ONLY on an explicit ack
(`/done`/`/reschedule`), a verified disappearance from the board, or a reschedule
out of the overdue window — never silently, never on a crash, and a `/snooze`
pauses but does NOT close it.

```bash
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh nag-check            # cron pass (top-N worst, every ~3h, work hrs)
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh nag-check --dry-run  # preview, no state write / push
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh nag-check --all      # cron pass with NO display cap (fire every overdue)
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh nag                  # `/nag all`: read-only full overdue list (no fire)
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh done <task_id>             # complete + close loop (same turn)
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh reschedule <task_id> <date># move due:: + close loop
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh snooze <task_id> <dur>     # pause loop (cap: 3 snoozes)
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh body-double <task_id> <dur># focus session + check-ins
bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh cancel-session <task_id>   # end a body-double session
```

- Q1-aware: thresholds are `NAG_Q1_THRESHOLD_DAYS=1`, `NAG_Q2_THRESHOLD_DAYS=3`,
  `NAG_Q3_THRESHOLD_DAYS=7`, read off the scalar `overdue_days` because
  `effective_priority()` short-circuits non-q2/q3 tasks to `escalated=False`.
- Display cap (`NAG_DISPLAY_LIMIT=3`): the cron push fires only the N worst-overdue
  tasks and appends a `+K more … reply /nag all` pointer, so an ADHD surface gets
  the top few instead of an unbounded dump. It is a FIRING bound, not a mute —
  deferred tasks open no loop that cycle but keep their place and surface as the
  leaders clear; the close/recycle resolve pass is never capped. `/nag` (`/nag all`)
  is the read-only full list; `nag-check --all` fires every overdue with no cap.
- Every nag push goes through `prove_delivery_target()` →
  `autonomy_gate.gate()` (act_id) → `assert_send_target()`. An unset
  `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_PRODUCTIVITY` / `OPENCLAW_TOPIC_PRODUCTIVITY_STANDUP` ⇒
  `nag_delivery_blocked:env_missing` and the loop STAYS OPEN.
- Delivery: each proven+gated+asserted nag text is emitted on `nag_check.py`'s
  stdout, which the cron job's explicit `delivery.to`
  (`${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_PRODUCTIVITY}:topic:${OPENCLAW_TOPIC_PRODUCTIVITY_STANDUP}`,
  topic 2) announces. A nag is counted as sent only once its text is collected
  for that announce — the script never logs `nag_sent` while delivering nothing.
- `nag_check.py` is READ-ONLY on the board; all board mutations happen through the
  reactive command path (`/done`, `/reschedule`).
- Body-double check-ins are ephemeral one-shot crons with `deleteAfterRun:true`
  and an explicit proven `delivery.to` + `agentId` set at session-start time.

**v0.3 — priority-first + tappable (U10, U3):** the intraday nag now leads with
**today's committed priorities** (the standup's `focus_state` daily 2-3 + the
EOD-set tomorrow-pointer #1) that aren't done yet — eligible even at zero days
overdue — each with a **▶️ Start** initiation button, then a reduced overdue tail.
A *reweight*, not a volume increase: `NAG_DISPLAY_LIMIT`, the H5 cadence, and
`/quiet` are unchanged. Each nag carries tap buttons (Done / Snooze 1d /
Reschedule▸) instead of copy-paste IDs, and the duplicate-delivery hole is closed
by a slot-bucketed idem-key (every fire of one cron slot — the scheduled fire, a
retry, a manual run before the next slot — delivers exactly once). Taps route
through the inline-button seam below.

### EOD ritual (U4–U7 — Productivity Group Done topic)

The end-of-day ritual is the canonical daily capture and the read side of the
morning standup. `bash scripts/telegram-commands.sh eod` runs the guided flow:

1. **Detect** — a read-only (`dry_run`) `done24h` harvest (merged PRs + sent mail
   matched to the board + manual `/win`s); nothing is consumed.
2. **Confirm** — each detected completion is a `✅ Confirm` button (`tt:appr`) that
   drives the existing topic-guarded, reversible `approve` gate. No board change
   without a tap.
3. **Disposition** — every still-open task gets a Done / Carry / Reschedule / Drop
   button row; an un-tapped task is reported "needs disposition" (the board is
   never silently mutated). `carry`/`drop` are reversible via `/undo`.
4. **Tomorrow's #1** — propose-then-confirm (`⭐ Set as #1`, `tt:top`) writes a
   single atomic `tomorrow-pointer.json` that the morning standup opens with.

The EOD delivers through the receipt-backed idempotent outbox (prove → gate →
`deliver_once`), records `eod_review` health, and upserts an idempotent
`## EOD Summary` (done / still-open / tomorrow's #1) to the Obsidian daily note —
the JSONL ledger stays the canonical audit. Runs as a deterministic command cron
(descriptor template in `eod_ritual.eod_cron_descriptor()`).

### Inline-button UX (U1–U2)

Telegram rituals are tappable instead of ID-typed. The **send** side
(`telegram_buttons.py` + the receipt-backed outbox `--presentation`) attaches
`tt:<action>:<task_id>` buttons; the **receive** side is a sideloaded gateway
plugin (`scripts/openclaw-plugins/task-tracker-interactive/`, namespace `tt`) plus
`callback_dispatch.py`, which route a tap into the **existing** deterministic
commands (done / snooze / reschedule / carry / drop / approve / set-top / start).
The plugin authorizes nothing — the skill command + topic guard are the single
authority, so a forged/stale tap can only no-op. `callback_data` is hard-capped at
64 bytes (over-budget → the button is dropped and the typed command survives).

### Conversational completion assistant (KTD8)

The gateway chat completion path is a sideloaded OpenClaw plugin plus the
existing interactive `tt:done` callback path:

- Plugin: `scripts/openclaw-plugins/task-tracker-envelope-signer/`
- Resolver: `chat_capture.resolve_for_confirm()` ranks open-task candidates
- Board write path: owner tap on `tt:done:<task_id>` handled by
  `scripts/openclaw-plugins/task-tracker-interactive/`

The plugin uses OpenClaw's broad `message_received` typed hook. That hook carries
the inbound text plus sender id, channel, message id, timestamp, and thread
metadata, and it is fire-and-forget so normal agent dispatch continues when the
assistant cannot resolve a hint. It recognizes leading completion phrases
(`done`, `finished`, `completed`, `did`, `✅`) and `/tasks` / `open`. Owner and
chat-scope gates run before any resolve or post.

Free-form prose is evidence only. A phrase such as `done the JAMS thing` may
narrow to one or more open, non-objective, non-recurring tasks and post
confirm/disambiguation buttons. The prose never writes the board, even for an
exact single match. The only chat completion authority is the existing
owner-authenticated `tt:done:<task_id>` tap/callback path. Human-visible labels
and messages must show task titles only, never task ids.

> **Operator step (required for the OpenClaw plugins to run):** register the
> relevant plugin in `openclaw.json` `plugins.allow` + `entries`, boot-sync it as
> REAL files into the AlphaClaw state root (never symlinks), and restart the
> gateway. Until then the buttons render but taps are silent no-ops, and the chat
> completion assistant does not observe inbound messages.

## Agent Invocation Guidance

Use explicit, workspace-relative paths when running commands from agents:

```bash
python3 <workspace>/<skill>/scripts/standup.py
python3 <workspace>/<skill>/scripts/tasks.py list
```

## References Index

Detailed docs moved to `references/`:

- `references/setup-and-config.md` — environment variables, defaults, setup flow
- `references/commands.md` — command catalog and examples
- `references/obsidian-and-dataview.md` — task structures, plugins, Dataview snippets
- `references/eod-sync.md` — EOD sync + weekly transclusion behavior
- `references/migration.md` — legacy migration and compatibility notes
- `references/task-format.md` — legacy task format spec

## Compatibility Notes

- Active task mutations require canonical `task_id::` values; fallback IDs are
  diagnostics only.
- `scripts/eod_sync.py` is report-only by default. `--apply` is a legacy Weekly
  TODO checkbox helper and does not complete canonical tasks.
- Legacy file fallback (`TASK_TRACKER_LEGACY_FILE`) is still supported.
- Migration guidance remains available in `references/migration.md`.
